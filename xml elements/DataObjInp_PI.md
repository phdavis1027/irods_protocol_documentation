This is a generic object for data object operations. The meaning of these fields can change depending on the operation being requested by the `intInfo` field of the corresponding `<MsgHeader_PI>`

- objPath: the absolute logical path of the data object or collection being acted upon or queried. 
- createMode: a single bit indicating whether a data object or collection is being created.
- openFlags: an integer bitmap representing file open options. Bit values and meanings are similar to their UNIX equivalents.
	- O_RDONLY
	- O_WRONLY
	- O_RDWR
	- O_TRUNC
- offset
- dataSize: in the context of a truncate operation, the size to which the data object will be truncated. In the context of a put operation, the size of the file being put. In the context of a stat operation, set to 0 (I would hazard this is true of most operations in which the size of the data object is unknown to the client at the time of issuing the command).
- numThreads: the number of threads to use for the operation. 
	- if 0, the server will decide how many threads to use.
	- if -1, only one thread will be used.
- oprType: the type of operation being performed.  Possible values (will format later):
	- DONE_OPR                9999
	- PUT_OPR                 1
	- GET_OPR                 2
	- SAME_HOST_COPY_OPR      3
	- COPY_TO_LOCAL_OPR       4
	- COPY_TO_REM_OPR         5
	- REPLICATE_OPR           6
	- REPLICATE_DEST          7
	- REPLICATE_SRC           8
	- COPY_DEST               9
	- COPY_SRC                10
	- RENAME_DATA_OBJ         11
	- RENAME_COLL             12
	- MOVE_OPR                13
	- RSYNC_OPR               14
	- PHYMV_OPR               15
	- PHYMV_SRC               16
	- PHYMV_DEST              17
	- QUERY_DATA_OBJ          18
	- QUERY_DATA_OBJ_RECUR    19
	- QUERY_COLL_OBJ          20
	- QUERY_COLL_OBJ_RECUR    21
	- RENAME_UNKNOWN_TYPE     22
	- REMOTE_ZONE_OPR         24
	- UNREG_OPR               26
 - SpecColl_PI: Optional, only included if objPath points to a special collection (e.g., a mounted collection).
 -  KeyValPair_PI: Optional, represents a CondInput struct.
